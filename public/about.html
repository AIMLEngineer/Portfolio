<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Abhishek Kumar, and I am currently in my 3rd year of pursuing a Bachelor of Technology 
(B.Tech) degree in CSE(AI & ML) at C.V. Raman Global University Odisha. It is with great 
enthusiasm that I write to express my profound interest in the Indian Academy Research 
Fellowship. I aspire to embark on a journey of research and innovation through this fellowship, 
and I firmly believe that my academic journey and personal aspirations align perfectly with the 
opportunities this fellowship offers. </p>

<p>My academic journey thus far has been consistently driven by a strong desire to acquire 
knowledge and a deep-rooted fascination with the field of AL & Machine Learning. 
Throughout my undergraduate studies in AI & ML at C.V. Raman Global University Odisha, 
I have been immersed in coursework that has provided me with a comprehensive foundation 
in the fundamental principles of Machine Learning. Courses like ML, python have not only 
made me learn more but have also sparked a strong interest to explore further in this field.</p> 

<p>While I am currently in the process of completing my B.Tech degree, my journey thus far has 
been marked by a commitment to learning and a drive to excel academically. I have consistently 
performed well in my coursework and have actively sought opportunities to apply my 
knowledge beyond the classroom. My commitment to grasping the details of AI & ML has 
motivated me to perform well in subjects like ML, and I've always worked hard to maintain a 
strong academic performance. </p>
